# DBBrowser
Commence RM Detail Form script for live inspecting of the database schema.

# Usage
Create a new Detail Form in any category. Tip: I use a dedicated one called 'Scripts', specifically for custom detail form scripts like this one. Create a layout as you see fit (see screenshots for example). Be sure to include the required controls. The form does not use any bound fields (=database fields). Check in the form script. Create an Agent that performs an Add Item, and displays this Detail Form.

Controls used in the script: see XML file.

# Limitations
MultiViews are not exposed by the Commence API and aren't listed.

# Note
This GIT was created just for archiving purposes. Do not expect updates.
